  <h1>Web Crawler Repository</h1>
  <p>This repository contains a web crawler that retrieves search engine results pages (<strong>SERPs</strong>) based on user-defined queries. The crawler is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook file named <strong>serp.ipynb</strong>, which includes the code for scraping search results and extracting relevant information. The output of the crawler is stored in two files: <strong>channel_data.csv</strong> and <strong>channel_data.json</strong>. Additionally, there is a file named <strong>Video Demo</strong> that provides an explanation of the code along with a running demonstration.</p>
  <h2>Files</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>serp.ipynb</strong>: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code for the web crawler. It utilizes web scraping techniques to fetch SERPs from search engines. The code is well-commented and organized into sections for easy understanding and modification.</li>
    <li><strong>channel_data.csv</strong>: This file stores the extracted information from the SERPs in CSV format. Each row represents a channel and includes relevant details such as the channel name, URL, description, and subscriber count. This file can be easily imported into spreadsheet software for further analysis or processing.</li>
    <li><strong>channel_data.json</strong>: This file stores the extracted information from the SERPs in JSON format. It follows a nested structure where each channel is represented as a JSON object containing key-value pairs for various attributes. JSON is a widely supported format and can be easily parsed by different programming languages.</li>
    <li><strong>Video Demo</strong>: This file provides a detailed explanation of the code in the <strong>serp.ipynb</strong> file. It includes a demonstration of running the code, showcasing its functionality and output. The video serves as a helpful resource for understanding and using the web crawler.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can find the required packages listed in the <strong>requirements.txt</strong> file.</li>
    <li>Open the <strong>serp.ipynb</strong> file in a Jupyter Notebook environment or compatible IDE.</li>
    <li>Customize the crawler by modifying the query and other parameters as needed. Detailed instructions and examples are provided within the notebook.</li>
    <li>Execute the code cells sequentially to run the web crawler. It will fetch the search results based on the specified query and extract relevant information from the SERPs.</li>
    <li>Once the code execution is complete, the extracted data will be saved in both <strong>channel_data.csv</strong> and <strong>channel_data.json</strong> files.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Demo</h2>
  <p>For a comprehensive explanation of the code and a visual demonstration of its functionality, refer to the <strong>Video Demo</strong> file. This video walks you through the steps involved in running the web crawler and showcases the resulting output.</p>
