# Web-Crawler

This repository contains a web crawler that retrieves search engine results pages **(SERPs) based on user-defined queries. The crawler is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook file named **serp.ipynb, which includes the code for scraping search results and extracting relevant information. The output of the crawler is stored in two files: **channel_data.csv and **channel_data.json. Additionally, there is a file named **Video Demo that provides an explanation of the code along with a running demonstration.

**Files
**serp.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code for the web crawler. It utilizes web scraping techniques to fetch SERPs from search engines. The code is well-commented and organized into sections for easy understanding and modification.

**channel_data.csv: This file stores the extracted information from the SERPs in CSV format. Each row represents a channel and includes relevant details such as the channel name, URL, description, and subscriber count. This file can be easily imported into spreadsheet software for further analysis or processing.

**channel_data.json: This file stores the extracted information from the SERPs in JSON format. It follows a nested structure where each channel is represented as a JSON object containing key-value pairs for various attributes. JSON is a widely supported format and can be easily parsed by different programming languages.

**Video Demo: This file provides a detailed explanation of the code in the serp.ipynb file. It includes a demonstration of running the code, showcasing its functionality and output. The video serves as a helpful resource for understanding and using the web crawler.

**Usage
To use the web crawler:

Open the **serp.ipynb file in a Jupyter Notebook environment or compatible IDE.

Customize the crawler by modifying the query and other parameters as needed. Detailed instructions and examples are provided within the notebook.

Execute the code cells sequentially to run the web crawler. It will fetch the search results based on the specified query and extract relevant information from the SERPs.

Once the code execution is complete, the extracted data will be saved in both **channel_data.csv and **channel_data.json files.

Demo
For a comprehensive explanation of the code and a visual demonstration of its functionality, refer to the Video Demo file. This video walks you through the steps involved in running the web crawler and showcases the resulting output.
